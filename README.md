I implemented Matrix Multiply Uniy, Weight FIFO, Systolic Data Setup, and Accumulator.

This systolic array can be scale up and down based on constants in constant_variable.py
It can successfully print out the result and offer the required cycle between dram and sram.

Check out one example of the result : output.pdf
